# Justice Democrats New Site!

This is cloned from https://github.com/AustinGreen/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms.

Continuous deployment is set up from master, so be careful!

## Running Locally

I'm using Node 8.11.2.

If you don't have `yarn`, which you can check with `yarn help`, run `npm i -g yarn`.

Install Gatsby CLI tools:

```
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

```
yarn install
yarn develop
```
