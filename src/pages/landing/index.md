introContent: >-
  **Instead of aligning with the needs of average working men and women,** the
  Democratic Party has allowed Republicans to take over most state legislatures,
  most governorships, Congress, and the presidency.


  **The solution is not unity with corporate-backed Democrats or catering to an
  imaginary “middle.” **The solution is to challenge them and replace every
  single one of them with people who will fight for voters, not donors.

  clear progressive vision with policies for people not corporations.
