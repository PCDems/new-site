intro: >-
  We’re running a broad slate of candidates across the country — most of whom we
  have counted on you to nominate. Some have been previously involved in
  politics but most are running for the first time; they are educators, nurses,
  small business owners and local community organizers. Every one of them
  concerned about their community, our country, and making sure every person has
  the same protections, rights and opportunity.
