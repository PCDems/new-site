intro: >-
  We’re running a broad slate of candidates across the country — many of who we
  have counted on you to nominated. Some have been previously involved in
  politics but many who are running or the first time, they are educators,
  nurses, small business owners and local activist. Every one of them concerned
  about their community,

  our country, and making sure every person has the same protections, rights and
  opportunity.
