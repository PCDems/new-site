blurb: >
  Matt Brown is running for Governor of Rhode Island to roll back the current Governor's restrictions on abortion, to end her failed and discredited attempt to "buy" a strong economy by spending millions of dollars on corporate giveaways at the expense of local citizens, and to build a sustainable local renewable energy economy that would make Rhode Island the first state in the country to not only produce all of its energy from renewable resources, but also to export surplus renewable energy to other states.  Brown is the former Secretary of State of Rhode Island and co-founder of City Year Rhode Island and of the Nobel Peace Prize-nominated organization Global Zero, which works to reduce and eliminate nuclear weapons.
