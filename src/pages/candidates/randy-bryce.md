blurb: >
  Randy Bryce is a U.S. Army veteran, cancer survivor, and union ironworker. He
  joined the race for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District because his values
  are our neighbors’ values, and Washington has gotten way off track. In
  Congress he will fight for Medicare For All, a living wage at $15/hour,
  combatting racism, and campaign finance reform.
