blurb: >
  Ben Jealous is a civil rights leader, community organizer, investor in startups for good, educator, former investigative journalist and a Rhodes Scholar who has spent his life 
  bringing people together to get big things done. Ben is running for Governor on a platform of bold, progressive ideas to address gaping inequality between the rich and poor, 
  including raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, passing Medicare for All to guarantee health care as a right, and ending student debt to make it possible for every Marylander 
  to attend community college, public university, or learn a trade for free.
