blurb: >
  Audrey Denney has never found a place she loves more than the North State. She is running for Congress in
  California's 1st District because she believes that the people of the North State deserve better.
  They deserve a representative who will respect and listen to them and who will fight for their needs and concerns in
  Washington D.C. She believes that the job is not about partisan politics, but about bringing people together, and finding a way forward as a community, a region, and a nation.
