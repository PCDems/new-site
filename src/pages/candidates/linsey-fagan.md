blurb: "It’s time for genuine leadership that puts the lives and livelihoods of everyday Texans first. It’s time for leaders who serve the people of Texas, not the special interests. Linsey Fagan is running to represent Texas’ 26th district because, for too long, Texans have been without accountable leadership in Washington."
