blurb: "Michael is a mediator, a union member, a NY State certified teacher, a decorated US Marine inducted into the NYS Senate Veteransâ€™ Hall of Fame,and a dad and husband. He believes that the promise of the American Dream is not a zero-sum game. He is a workforce expert who believes in Medicare for All, protecting Social Security, and in closing income inequality gaps with union strength. He doesn't take corporate money from any source. 
He is fighting for a GREEN New Deal to finally fix our crumbling roads, overcrowded schools, and deteriorating shorelines.  Michael is working to flip NY11 (Staten Island and South Brooklyn) the only Red seat in New York City, a seat he knows belongs to the people - not the corporations or party bosses. "
