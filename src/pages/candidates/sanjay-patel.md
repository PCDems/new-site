blurb: "Sanjay is a first-generation immigrant and former small business owner who is running to represent Floridaâ€™s 8th congressional district. As local opportunities expand in space travel and exploration, Sanjay aims to ensure fair wages and reasonable cost of living for teachers, firefighters, service professionals and all working people. Sanjay supports Medicare for All, reducing interest rates on student debt, and fair taxation that ensures that hardworking Floridians and small business owners don't foot the bill for infrastructure and public services that disproportionately benefit big businesses and billionaires.
