blurb: >-
  New Yorkâ€™s 14th Congressional District urgently needs access to more reliable
  jobs, increased access to family support services like parental leave and free
  childcare. She will fight for universal access to quality education from pre-K
  until college regardless of income and enrollment status because your ZIP code
  should never determine your quality of life.
