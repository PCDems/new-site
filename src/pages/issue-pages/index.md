    intro: >-
      We need a bold economic vision that will both reclaim lost capital and put
      money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans, and create millions
      of new jobs for those who have been left out of the workforce.

      The growing disparities in income and wealth among our nation’s citizenry
      have long-term impacts on our population — for wealth accumulation, debt
      reduction, and educational attainment.

    intro: >-
      We cannot afford to continue partisan jockeying on these issues, there is
      too much at stake. Americans must be provided a better chance to succeed
      in the face of rising income inequality and continued machinations by
      corporate giants.

**Opinion polls in the United States demonstrate that these policy positions are overwhelmingly popular.** Indeed, throughout the industrialized world these ideas are considered moderate. This is a movement about freedom and justice. And it’s a movement of, by, and for working people. If the Democrats refuse to embrace this platform, they’ll continue to lose, either to Republicans or to us.

**The future of the Democratic party is the Justice wing, not the establishment wing.**
