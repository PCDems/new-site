    intro: >-
      We need a bold economic vision that will both reclaim lost capital and put
      money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans, and create millions
      of new jobs for those who have been left out of the workforce.
    planks:
      - contents: >-
          The idea behind a federal jobs guarantee is that anyone who wants to
          work and contribute but can’t find a way to do that in the economy can
          do that. A federal jobs guarantee program would establish a floor for
          wages and benefits for the nation’s workforce. This program would
          provide a baseline minimum wage of $15 an hour and guarantee for
          public workers a basic benefits package, including healthcare and
          childcare. By investing in our own workforce, we can lift thousands of
          American families out of poverty and get people to work doing the work
          that needs to be done.

          This is about justice and basic human decency. If you work hard and
          you work full time you shouldn’t live in poverty. Furthermore, we
          support strong unions and collective bargaining.
        title: Secure a Living Wage and Tie it to Inflation
      - contents: >-
          Scientists are sounding the alarm on climate change. In order to avoid
          the worst case scenario and a dystopian future we need a massive green
          revolution. It’s time to drastically and immediately move away from
          fossil fuels and develop the technologies of the future. This will be
          a giant boon to both the private and public sector, as well as a
          necessary response to a global crisis. We can and we must be #1 in
          sustainable energy production in the world.
        title: Create the Renewable Energy Revolution
      - contents: >-
          Our infrastructure gets a grade of D from the Society of Civil
          Engineers. The government should invest trillions in rebuilding our
          crumbling roads, bridges, schools, levees, airports etc. There’s no
          reason why we can’t have the world’s #1 infrastructure.
        title: Build the New New Deal
      - contents: >-
          As a result of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China and the WTO, Americans
          have lost millions of decent paying jobs. It’s time to end the race to
          the bottom and renegotiate these rigged deals that only benefit
          elites. We should not sacrifice our sovereignty, the only people who
          are allowed to make laws for the United States should be the American
          people, not multinational corporations.

          Block Bad Trade Deals + Oppose Outsourcing That Damanges the
          Middle-Class
      - contents: >-
          Corporations dodge $450 billion a year in taxes by using offshore tax
          havens. We should end this injustice, as well as chain the capital
          gains tax to the income tax, increase the estate tax, and implement
          the Buffet Rule so that no millionaire CEO pays less in taxes than his
          or her secretary. It’s time for a tax system that benefits the
          middle-class and the poor, and makes the top 1% and multinational
          corporations pay their fair share.

          The United States maintains 800 military bases worldwide at a cost of
          $100 billion a year. This is money that can be spent at home creating
          jobs, rebuilding infrastructure, and investing in the future of the
          people. The disastrous war in Iraq cost trillions, the war in
          Afghanistan is going on 17 years in with no end in sight, and we’re
          currently bombing 7 different countries. We spend more on our military
          than the next 8 countries combined. Despite countless lives lost and
          destroyed, terrorism has only gotten worse. It’s time to end the wars
          and the perverse monetary-incentive structure that makes politicians
          flippant about sending young men and women to die. Unilateral U.S.
          military force should only be used as a last resort to defend the
          nation. The current budget could be cut drastically if we used our
          department of defense for what it was intended—defending us, instead
          of waging interventionist wars.

      The growing disparities in income and wealth among our nation’s citizenry
      have long-term impacts on our population — for wealth accumulation, debt
      reduction, and educational attainment.

    intro: >-
      We cannot afford to continue partisan jockeying on these issues, there is
      too much at stake. Americans must be provided a better chance to succeed
      in the face of rising income inequality and continued machinations by
      corporate giants.

**Opinion polls in the United States demonstrate that these policy positions are overwhelmingly popular.** Indeed, throughout the industrialized world these ideas are considered moderate. This is a movement about freedom and justice. And it’s a movement of, by, and for working people. If the Democrats refuse to embrace this platform, they’ll continue to lose, either to Republicans or to us.

**The future of the Democratic party is the Justice wing, not the establishment wing.**
